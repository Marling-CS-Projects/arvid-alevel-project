# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution's functionality. Whilst individual implementations of the solution's sections may work as intended, there is no guarantee that things haven't broken when new features are implemented.

| Test | Instructions                              | What I expect                                                                                 | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |

| 1    | Run the code                              | A node console should appear with information about the server                                | As Expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Connect to the server with localhost:8081 | A black screen with a platform and player, which should fall onto the platform and stay there | As Expected           | Pass      |

| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run the code                                                     | The player appears and falls onto a screen-wide platform                              | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Arrow key pressed as player is in air                            | The player should not move                                                            | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Arrow key tapped whilst player is on the ground                  | The player should move slightly in the pressed direction                              | As expected           | Pass      |
| 4    | Arrow key held down when grounded                                | The player should accelerate to a point, then continue moving (in correct direction)  | As expected           | Pass      |
| 5    | Arrow key held but the maxVelocity and baseVelocity are the same | The player should move but not accelerate as the maxVelocity has already been reached | As expected           | Pass      |
| 6    | Arrow key released                                               | The player stops moving                                                               | As expected           | Pass      |
| 7    | Arrow key released and then repressed and held again             | The player stops moving, then accelerates again from the baseVelocity                 | As expected           | Pass      |

| 1    | Run the code                         | A white rectangle falls onto some grey platforms on a black background.                                              | As expected                                                              | Pass      |
| 2    | Tap arrow keys                       | The player moves slightly in the direction of the pressed key                                                        | As expected                                                              | Pass      |
| 3    | Hold arrow key and release           | The player should accelerate then decelerate and stop                                                                | As expected                                                              | Pass      |
| 4    | Hold arrow keys and keep holding     | The player should accelerate to a point, and then keep moving at a constant velocity                                 | The player accelerates and keeps accelerating at a constant rate         | Fail      |
| 5    | Hold arrow keys and change direction | Player should accelerate to a point, then decelerate before accelerating again when turning, with a maximum velocity | The player turns with no delay and keeps accelerating at a constant rate | Fail      |
| 6    | Hold arrow keys when in air          | Player should not move                                                                                               | As expected                                                              | Pass      |
