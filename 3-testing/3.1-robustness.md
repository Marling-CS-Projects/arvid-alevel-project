# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

For my game to be considered functional, I set 2 main criteria that needed to ne achieved: the game had to run at a stable framerate, with no changes large enough to be noticed; the game had to start-up and then run without crashing.

| Criterion | Description                                                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 28        | Game shouldn't crash                                                                         |
| 30        | The game should run at a consistent frame-rate, high enough for the gameplay to feel smooth. |
