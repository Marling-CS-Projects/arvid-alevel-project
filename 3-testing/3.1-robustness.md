# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

For my game to be considered functional, I set 2 main criteria that needed to be achieved: the game had to run at a stable framerate, with no changes large enough to be noticed; the game had to start-up and then run without crashing.

| Criterion | Description                                                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 28        | Game shouldn't crash                                                                         |
| 30        | The game should run at a consistent frame-rate, high enough for the gameplay to feel smooth. |

### Criterion 28

To ensure no bugs were present which would cause the game to crash or stop functioning, 'systematically' pressed random input keys in various locations and conditions (in air, against walls, on ground, from full speed and from standing). There were few significant issues that arose from this, only one of which would be seen commonly in gameplay and the others which could be fixed very easily by adding more tiles.

* The player would sometimes fall through the floor if the boundary of a wall and ground tile overlapped perfectly
* The player could randomly get stuck when sliding down long, multi-tiled walls, getting stuck on the boundary of 2 tiles
* The player's slide + jump could sometimes result in the player being unable to move again after the jump was complete if the jump key was released and slide key pressed again as the player hit the ground. If the player was pressing random keys whilst moving, this could cause the player to have to restart and lose all progress.

### Criterion 30
