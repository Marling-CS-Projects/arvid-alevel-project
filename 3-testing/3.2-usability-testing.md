# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | The controls were easy to learn and use, The in game instructions were clear and easy to follow, I could tell the player, hazards and terrain apart from each other easily |
| 2 - Efficient      | There was a good amount of controls, The in game instructions were clear and easy to follow.                                                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | How challenging did you find the game, How fun did you find the game, The movement system was intuitive, The movement was varied and felt dynamic.                         |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you find any bugs in gameplay, Did the bugs have a negative impact on your experience                                                                                  |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The controls were easy to learn and use, You understood how to use the different movement options.                                                                         |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

#### Question 1:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Asking this question gauged the effectiveness of the limited UI and implementation of controls. Asking this was important to know if the game was too vague to be enjoyed. The majority of people seemed to be able to understand, so I will consider this a pass.

#### Question 2:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I had visual clarity as a major target to achieve for accessibility reasons. It was important to make gameplay easier to focus on and the game more enjoyable. Every player agreed that the colours and visual style were clear, and potentially confusing sections (terrain, obstacles, the player) could be told apart easily.

#### Question 3:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The point of this question was to ensure the movement system's complexity achieved it's purpose of allowing better movement control and variety than the stock phaser movement. If it had more options and better depth of control, the player could have more control and engage more with the game. As all who participated agreed that this was the case, this test was a pass and the complexity achieved what it needed to.

#### Question 4:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An intuitive movement system implied that the movement felt as if it made sense: did the movement feel natural, and did the way it behaved to inputs look the way a player would expect it to. This was again important to ask as having a movement system that made sense to a player made it more immersive, hence more engaging to play. It's clear from the results this is a very subjective matter, with the majority somewhat agreeing it was intuitive. This likely depends on what their previous experience with games like it are, and how much of the movement they used.

#### Question 5:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was asked for similar reasons to the previous question. If the movement system did not feel smooth when being used, hence the player feeling hard to control, then this would ultimately hinder the experience of the rest of the game for the user. Overall, most people agreed that the movement didn't feel choppy and hard to control.

The participants who said neutral for Question 5 weren't the same people who said neutral for Question 4.

#### Question 6:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I asked this question to try and find an overlap between Question 1 and Questions 4/5. While the instructions of a game could be clear, and the movement might feel good to use and work well, this is of little use if the initial controls are what is gatekeeping the player. Overall, I am less satisfied with the response to this question. While observing testing, I did not see any particular player would struggled to control the player once controls were read, but as no one disagreed I suspect the larger disparity in this question is due to the unusual key I chose to assign jump to, 'Z'. This shows my controls weren't as effective as they could've been, and may need revising.

#### Question 7:

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4         | The game will use different colours to differentiate between elements.                                                                   |
| 6         | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                                                    |
| 23        | The UI should not have require any labels to be read.                                                                                    |
| 27        | Violence and other sensitive topics will be present but limited to allow for as wide an audience as possible (no inappropriate content). |
| 29        | Everything should be consistent in style and visual clarity.                                                                             |
