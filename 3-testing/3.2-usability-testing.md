# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | The controls were easy to learn and use, The in game instructions were clear and easy to follow, I could tell the player, hazards and terrain apart from each other easily |
| 2 - Efficient      | There was a good amount of controls, The in game instructions were clear and easy to follow.                                                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | How challenging did you find the game, How fun did you find the game, The movement system was intuitive, The movement was varied and felt dynamic.                         |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you find any bugs in gameplay, Did the bugs have a negative impact on your experience                                                                                  |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The controls were easy to learn and use, You understood how to use the different movement options.                                                                         |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

#### Question 1:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Asking this question gauged the effectiveness of the limited UI and implementation of controls. Asking this was important to know if the game was too vague to be enjoyed. The majority of people seemed to be able to understand, so I will consider this a pass.

#### Question 2:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I had visual clarity as a major target to achieve for accessibility reasons. It was important to make gameplay easier to focus on and the game more enjoyable. Every player agreed that the colours and visual style were clear, and potentially confusing sections (terrain, obstacles, the player) could be told apart easily.

#### Question 3:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The point of this question was to ensure the movement system's complexity achieved it's purpose of allowing better movement control and variety than the stock phaser movement. If it had more options and better depth of control, the player could have more control and engage more with the game. As all who participated agreed that this was the case, this test was a pass and the complexity achieved what it needed to.

#### Question 4:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An intuitive movement system implied that the movement felt as if it made sense: did the movement feel natural, and did the way it behaved to inputs look the way a player would expect it to. This was again important to ask as having a movement system that made sense to a player made it more immersive, hence more engaging to play. It's clear from the results this is a very subjective matter, with the majority somewhat agreeing it was intuitive. This likely depends on what their previous experience with games like it are, and how much of the movement they used. The short length of the experience likely contributed to the neutral opinions, as the players didn't have as much time to get used to the movement as I would have liked them to.

#### Question 5:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was asked for similar reasons to the previous question. If the movement system did not feel smooth when being used, hence the player feeling hard to control, then this would ultimately hinder the experience of the rest of the game for the user. Overall, most people agreed that the movement didn't feel choppy and hard to control.

The participants who said neutral for Question 5 weren't the same people who said neutral for Question 4.

#### Question 6:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I asked this question to try and find an overlap between Question 1 and Questions 4/5. While the instructions of a game could be clear, and the movement might feel good to use and work well, this is of little use if the initial controls are what is gatekeeping the player. Overall, I am less satisfied with the response to this question. While observing testing, I did not see any particular player would struggled to control the player once controls were read, but as no one disagreed I suspect the larger disparity in this question is due to the unusual key I chose to assign jump to, 'Z'. This shows my controls weren't as effective as they could've been, and may need revising.

#### Question 7:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A key usability feature of my project was being efficient for the user. For this, controls would be a major concern, as too many meant the player wasting time remembering and learning controls rather than playing the game, and too few wouldn't give the player enough options to feel comfortable. This could also reflect badly on the way the movement system felt to use and learn, despite not directly affecting functionality, ruining the overall experience.

#### Question 8:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Due to the way the game's movement was implemented, it was crucial every player knew how to use it to it's fullest. I attempted to make it was intuitive as possible to minimize a need for instructions, but added basic instructions for things such as controls and what they did. Overall, almost everyone who played was able to use the movement options completely, with the disagreeing being as a result of not using the instructions properly.

#### Question 9:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Due to measures taken in development, there was a minimized amount of bugs. Testing for bugs was important to me as finding them could reveal interesting gameplay options I otherwise would not have discovered (it's a "feature"), and to know if a bugs affects the game in the aforementioned positive way or in a negative way which ruins the experience.

#### Question 10:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question revealed 1 of 2 things. Either 5 of the people who answered this couldn't read, or were lying in the first part of the question. Fortunately, the only tester who experienced a bug confirmed it didn't have a direct negative impact on their experience. While this doesn't mean it can stay as a feature, it also means it wasn't game breaking.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The only bug experienced was the player body being able to pass through the flat face of another body horizontally when between the flat face and a circular body, in this case a rotating one. I was not able to reproduce the bug and nothing similar was experienced from other testers when they landed in a similar position. As this bug seemed relatively situational and the exact cause was not found, it is unknown how or if it can be fixed, but it shouldn't occur often enough to cause significant issues.

#### Question 11:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All the other questions aimed to address the main goal of a game though: being fun. If the game was fun it would ultimately be more engaging for the player, hence making it more fun as the player gets more invested. The other aspects such as ease to learn, and clarity can help reduce the potential learning curve and reduce the chances to get frustrated, meaning the player is more likely to enjoy the experience. Overall, everyone found the game at least a 4 or 5 for fun, where 1 was boring and 5 was very fun, 3 assumed to be indifferent and I definitely consider this a success.

#### Question 12:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another key part to engagement is keeping the player's focus on the game. A way I sought to do this was by making the game challenging. This is a double edged sword, because some players may not enjoy the game if it is too hard, whereas some may be looking for that experience. Difficulty is also subjective, further amplifying the issue. Overall, I expected to see a good spread of answers but hoped to get the majority in one of the middle sections, as I ranked this on a scale of 1 being too easy and 5 being too hard. The results I collected were less than ideal, but demonstrate that player skill and varies widely.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4         | The game will use different colours to differentiate between elements.                                                                   |
| 6         | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                                                    |
| 23        | The UI should not have require any labels to be read.                                                                                    |
| 27        | Violence and other sensitive topics will be present but limited to allow for as wide an audience as possible (no inappropriate content). |
| 29        | Everything should be consistent in style and visual clarity.                                                                             |

#### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Using different colours would be a clear way to distinguish between different elements of the game at a glance and is clear for effective clarity. I consider this a successful test, as every tester agreed that colours were different between different aspects. This is a reinforcement of question 2, and shows that the differing colours played a vital role in the differentiation between player, terrain, and hazard. The slight discrepancy in question 2 where 2 testers only agreed, not strongly agreed, is something I would like to address but cannot find a source for, and would likely have to get a greater sample size to see what the cause was.

#### Criterion 6:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The purpose for criterion 6 being assessed was ensure the minimalised UI wasn't a hinderance to the player instead of fulfilling it's intended purpose and reducing visual cluttering and distractions. Again, every tester agreed, most of them strongly meaning the simplified UI was successful in its purpose. This contributes to the other usability aspects, such as the instructions (question 1) conditionally, the player's clarity (question 2), and how fun the game was (question 11). Conditions for it affecting question 1 is weather or not the UI is understandable in it's minimalized state.

#### Criterion 23:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question may seem redundant compared to the previous question. This is not the case, and while it explains and reinforces the same types of questions, it addresses a different issue. If the UI wasn't visually cluttered but impossible to understand, then there wouldn't be much point to it being simplified, or to be there at all. Ensuring everyone understood what the UI was representing would validate the simplified, unlabelled implementation, again making sure it wasn't a hinderance.

#### Criterion 27:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For the game to be accessible to the widest audience possible the inclusion of inappropriate material would have to be limited. As there needed to be a state which represented failing the level, some form of&#x20;
