## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | The controls were easy to learn and use, The in game instructions were clear and easy to follow, I could tell the player, hazards and terrain apart from each other easily |
| 2 - Efficient      | There was a good amount of controls, The in game instructions were clear and easy to follow.                                                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | How challenging did you find the game, How fun did you find the game, The movement system was intuitive, The movement was varied and felt dynamic.                         |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you find any bugs in gameplay, Did the bugs have a negative impact on your experience                                                                                  |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The controls were easy to learn and use, You understood how to use the different movement options.                                                                         |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

#### Question 1:

Asking this question gauged the effectiveness of the limited UI and implementation of controls. Asking this was important to know if the game was too vague to be enjoyed. The majority of people seemed to be able to understand, so I will consider this a pass.

#### Question 2:

I had visual clarity as a major target to achieve for accessibility reasons. It was important to make gameplay easier to focus on and the game more enjoyable. Every player agreed that the colours and visual style were clear, and potentially confusing sections (terrain, obstacles, the player) could be told apart easily.

#### Question 3:

The point of this question was to ensure the movement system's complexity was&#x20;

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4         | The game will use different colours to differentiate between elements.                                                                   |
| 6         | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                                                    |
| 23        | The UI should not have require any labels to be read.                                                                                    |
| 27        | Violence and other sensitive topics will be present but limited to allow for as wide an audience as possible (no inappropriate content). |
| 29        | Everything should be consistent in style and visual clarity.                                                                             |
