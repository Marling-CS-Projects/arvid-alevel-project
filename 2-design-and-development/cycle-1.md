## Design

### Objectives

I plan to create a webpage using html and javascript to host the game. I have tested several libraries for purpose of creation of the game, and Phaser seems like it will be the most appropriate for my game because it has support for matter.js, a library focused on physics. On the webpage, use phaser to make a character and have it fall from where it's created onto a platform.

* [ ] Make a html/javascript project
* [ ] Create a webpage using node and express
* [ ] Have it redirect automatically redirect to a page with Phaser
* [ ] Create an object to represent the player and have it fall onto a platform

### Usability Features

* Automatic redirect - Ease of use/efficiency. The player won't have to try and connect to the game manually, saving time and reducing the chance a player would be confused.
* Clear visuals - The object representing the player will be a vastly different colour from the background, and should be easily recognisable from the ground
