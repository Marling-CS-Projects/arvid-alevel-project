### Gamers

Gamers across the world have only risen in numbers in recent years, and will likely continue to do so. In the UK alone, there has been a steady increase in the number of people who play videogames, from 44.3 million in 2021, to a predicted 51.8 million in 2025 (J. Clement, 2021a). As for worldwide statistics, there was an estimated 3.24 billion gamers worldwide in 2021 out of  the global population of approximately 7.87 billion in that year: that's about 41.2% of the world's population playing videogames. Of the players sampled in the UK, the largest percentage per population were aged between 16 and 24, with 92% of 16 to 24 year olds sampled stating they played videogames (J. Clement, 2021b). The American based Entertainment Software Association gives similar results, with 70% of under 18s and 64% of over 18s playing videogames. Their survey determined that about 75% of Americans had at least 1 videogame in their household (Entertainment Software Association, 2020)**.**

It is clear that a videogames have a wide reach, and so understanding the types of players who play a game can contribute to what style and topics the game should cover if it expects to be successful or have an impact on society. In this case, the vast majority of young adults and older teens play videogames and hence what they play can influence their culture. The inverse should be taken into account: the cultural context that a videogame is made in can define what topics it aims to cover, and what style of game it is.

Younger audiences tend to prefer action games, with a large preference for them coming from the male audience who preferred FPS, Adventure and Role-Playing games, with the female audience preferring Action and Racing games second to party games. This trend generally continues as audiences grow older (Entertainment Software Association, 2020).

Taking all these factors into account, it is clear an action based game would be ideal for appealing to the most people, especially for the generation that has it's largest proportion playing videogames and has the greatest logical self-interest in addressing social and personal issues that will affect their future lives. A game aimed at this audience will have the greatest reach and be generally received better across all demographics.

## Demographics

PEGI ratings can have a huge affect on how a game is marketed and sold. According to PEGI's official site, on average games with a lower PEGI rating hold a larger market share (pegi.info, n.d.). Their statistics from 2003 show games rated PEGI 3 hold a 37.1% market share, gradually decreasing as the ratings get higher to only 8.3% for games with a rating of PEGI 18. This does not seem to hold true for recent years however. According to PEGI's official site once again, between the years of 2018 to 2020 there was an increase in market share of PEGI 18 rated games from 10.6% to 16.2%, whereas lower PEGI rated games more or less stayed the same, with a slight decrease to the middles ratings of 12 and 16. These statistics somewhat match statistics from 2020 in Italy (Statista, 2021) showing a majority share for PEGI 3 rated games and a larger share of PEGI 18 rated games.

### How are games rated

PEGI ratings are known to have an impact on how a game is sold, so how are PEGI ratings decided? The official PEGI site says that companies must complete a review of their game to figure out what rating it should be: things such as depictions of nudity, innuendo, varying degrees of violence and use of 'strong language' or substances are all taken into account and drastically affect the predicted rating of a game. Other things such as topics covered, such as glamourizing crime can increase a game's rating (Parent Zone, 2012). Game difficulty is not taken in to account, however it can be assumed more mature audiences will enjoyer tougher games.

Evoking emotion will be better for leaving a lasting effect on players and getting players to connect with topics relating to social issues and mental health, thus an amount of sensitive content should be covered to get the desired effect, but not to the extent that it limits access to the game.
