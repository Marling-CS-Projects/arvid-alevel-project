### Gamers

Gamers across the world have only risen in numbers in recent years, and will likely continue to do so.

In the UK alone, there has been a steady increase in the number of people who play videogames, from 44.3 million in 2021, to a predicted 51.8 million in 2025 (J. Clement, 2021). As for worldwide statistics, there was an estimated 3.24 billion gamers worldwide in 2021 out of  the global population of approximately 7.87 billion in that year: that's about 41.2% of the world's population playing videogames. Of those players&#x20;

## Demographics

PEGI ratings can have a huge affect on how a game is marketed and sold. According to PEGI's official site, on average games with a lower PEGI rating hold a larger market share (pegi.info, n.d.). Their statistics from 2003 show games rated PEGI 3 hold a 37.1% market share, gradually decreasing as the ratings get higher to only 8.3% for games with a rating of PEGI 18. This does not seem to hold true for recent years however. According to PEGI's official site once again, between the years of 2018 to 2020 there was an increase in market share of PEGI 18 rated games from 10.6% to 16.2%, whereas lower PEGI rated games more or less stayed the same, with a slight decrease to the middles ratings of 12 and 16. These statistics somewhat match statistics from 2020 in Italy (Statista, 2021) showing a majority share for PEGI 3 rated games and a larger share of PEGI 18 rated games.

### How are games rated

PEGI ratings are known to have an impact on how a game is sold, so how are PEGI ratings decided? The official PEGI site says that companies must complete a review of their game to figure out what rating it should be: things such as depictions of nudity, innuendo, varying degrees of violence and use of 'strong language' or substances are all taken into account and drastically affect the predicted rating of a game. Other things such as topics covered, such as glamourizing crime can increase a game's rating (Parent Zone, 2012). Game difficulty is not taken in to account, however it can be assumed more mature audiences will enjoyer tougher games.
