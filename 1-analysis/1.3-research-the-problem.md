## Rainworld

\[Collect Some Screenshots]

### Overview

Rainworld is an... interesting game. It takes place in a ruined world abandoned by a long dead civilisation. The ecosystem they left behind is unkind to the player, going against the usual design philosophy of games in it's genre of the world existing for the player to explore, and the player as a main character. Instead, the player is only a part of their own story, the rest of the game feeling as if it could continue without the player's involvement, in fact it does.
