### Overview

Rainworld is a 2D, survival-themed metroidvania where they player isn't the main character beyond whatever story they choose to write for themselves. It differs from other games in its genre as it doesn't provide a well defined combat system, or necessarily have enemies. The world you are dropped into has you playing as a Slugcat - near the bottom of the food chain. You are abandoned, confused and lost. Most games would ease the player into this experience with easier regions near the beginning of the game and powerups unlocked as you progress to help you feel stronger. Rain world completely abandons this concept, treating you harshly to emphasise the fact that you are not the main character, just another part of the world. The other creatures are neither friend or foe but just other creatures trying to survive, behaving accordingly. Furthermore, no section of the game is inaccessible from the beginning: it is completely open and leaves the player to decide where they wish to go. It feels alive, separate from the player and is overall a unique experience.

### The Movement

Gameplay wise, this game's movement is unparalleled in terms of the feeling of reward for learning it, but feels extremely punishing to try and learn and has no training in game for most of the more complicated movement tricks. It is unbelievably lenient in what it allows for, and allows for creativity from the player to make up new ways to get around. It feels satisfying to get right and allows for more risks to be taken in game as well as alternate paths to what the game may originally seem to offer, but if gotten wrong or not known about the movement leaves the player feeling rather helpless or worse, frustrated.

It's incredibly open due to the 'active input' system it has. Very rarely is the player locked out from inputting movement commands, allowing for last second changes to a movement, or a redirection of one currently in motion. This means the system behind it has to be robust to allow for player creativity, and requires the map to be designed to encourage creativity. This is a good system, as it leaves the player fully in control.

### The Wildlife (NPCs)

The main feature of Rain World is the world you explore. The world isn't just the physical terrain in this case, but the wildlife around it. All other beings encountered, predator or prey, have their own lives and behave according to their needs. This is unlike other metroidvania style games, where the NPCs exist only to serve as 'things' they player can interact with and rarely exist to any purpose other than to create action for the player: they have no individual purpose. The NPCs in Rain World are different. Each of them has complex AI, memories, their own friends and enemies. If the player was not there, the NPCs in Rain World could still exist in a small virtual ecosystem independent of the player. This helps create an environment for the player to explore beyond what games can usually offer, as the world feels more alive.

### 'Combat'

Combat in Rain World is what would usually be expected from a game of it's style. There isn't a combat system beyond picking objects up and throwing them. There is no system specifically implemented to aim, there isn't a clear health system, and the player has no permanent attack or weapon. It can feel incredibly bland, but again the active input system from the movement allows for full control of the direction of throw and for tricks such as, e.g., slide throwing to get extra damage. Each creature also has a weak point or something it fears which allows for the player to control or a situation to allow for an advantageous outcome or avoid a confrontation all together.

### Music

Music in video games is a personal favourite of mine when done well. The genius of musical storytelling in Hollow Knight, the emotional and claustrophobic motifs of Celeste and the atmospheric score that follows you through Ori and its journey in the Blind Forest. Rain World uses music in a similar way to all of them: it sets a mood to help create the scene. The way it's unique is in its implementation of this: it has layers to a soundtrack which it adds or removes depending on what the player is doing, where they are in a region or what threats approach them. While this isn't uncommon in a game, it is something that's definitely noticeable in Rain World.

## Hollow Knight

\[Screenshots go here, also I should probably beat the game...]

### Overview

Hollow Knight is one of the most highly acclaimed and best selling metroidvanias released in recent years. It sold more than 500,000 copies in its released year of 2017, doubling in the following year. Its sequel Silksong has just as large a following to the point where it is almost cult-like, despite no promised release date. It has a vast world with unique enemies and friends that inhabit each region. The combat system is diverse and adaptable: the player can make decisions on how they want to fight, or change the way they fight based off of the encounter. Nothing feels like it was forced into the game for the purpose of it being a game, as everything feels like it fits into the context of Hollow Knight's world.&#x20;

### Combat

At base level, the combat system in Hollow Knight is very simple. You can strike in 4 directions, and hitting things or being hit does damage. There are also spells: they do more damage, have range and area damage, but cost a resource to cast and are unlocked as the game progresses. Despite this very simple system, the combat is diverse and leaves you with multiple options for every situation. It feels relatively balanced as any enemy you encounter at the intended time is designed to be the right type of challenging, getting more complex as you progress and get used to the game.

### Upgrades and Charms

Hollow Knight allows for full customisation in the way you do combat through its unique progression system.&#x20;

Firstly the main weapon, or 'nail'. This will most likely be used no matter what style you play. It is relatively hard to upgrade to the maximum level, and it is limited in range. You get a maximum of 3 abilities, unlocked only after tough platforming challenges at the edges of the world. As it is a weapon that costs nothing to use and is available from the beginning this is understandable for balance reasons. They simple damage upgrades require scavenging for Pale ore and collection of vast amounts of the in game currency, Shells. This means the nail should scale up to help deal with stronger enemies and never feel too strong in a new area, but are still completely optional; they are not necessary to beat a new area should the player wish to give themselves a challenge.

Secondly, the Charms. Charms in Hollow Knight are equipable tokens that give certain effects.&#x20;
