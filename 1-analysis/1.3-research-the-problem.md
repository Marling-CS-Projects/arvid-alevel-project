### Overview

Rainworld is a game where they player isn't the main character beyond whatever story they choose  to write for themselves. The world you are dropped into has you playing as a Slugcat - near the bottom of the food chain. You are abandoned, confused and lost. Most games would ease the player into this experience with easier regions near the beginning of the game and powerups unlocked as you progress to help you feel stronger. Rain world completely abandons this concept, treating you harshly to emphasise the fact that you are not the main character, just another part of the world. The other creatures are neither friend or foe but just other creatures trying to survive, behaving accordingly. It feels alive separate from the player and is overall a unique experience.

### The Movement

Gameplay wise, this game's movement is unparalleled in terms of the feeling of reward for learning it, but feels extremely punishing to try and learn and has no training in game for most of the more complicated movement tricks. It is unbelievably lenient in what it allows for, and allows for creativity from the player to make up new ways to get around. It feels satisfying to get right and allows for more risks to be taken in game as well as alternate paths to what the game may originally seem to offer, but if gotten wrong or not known about the movement leaves the player feeling rather helpless or worse, frustrated.

It's incredibly open due to the 'active input' system it has. Very rarely is the player locked out from inputting movement commands, allowing for last second changes to a movement, or a redirection of one currently in motion. This means the system behind it has to be robust to allow for player creativity, and requires the map to be designed to encourage creativity. This is a good system, as it leaves the player fully in control.

### The Wildlife (NPCs)

The main feature of Rain World is the world you explore. The world isn't just the physical terrain&#x20;
