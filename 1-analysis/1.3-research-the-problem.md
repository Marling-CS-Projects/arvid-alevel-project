### Overview

Rainworld is a 2D, survival-themed metroidvania where they player isn't the main character beyond whatever story they choose to write for themselves. It differs from other games in its genre as it doesn't provide a well defined combat system, or necessarily have enemies. The world you are dropped into has you playing as a Slugcat - near the bottom of the food chain. You are abandoned, confused and lost. Most games would ease the player into this experience with easier regions near the beginning of the game and powerups unlocked as you progress to help you feel stronger. Rain world completely abandons this concept, treating you harshly to emphasise the fact that you are not the main character, just another part of the world. The other creatures are neither friend or foe but just other creatures trying to survive, behaving accordingly. Furthermore, no section of the game is inaccessible from the beginning: it is completely open and leaves the player to decide where they wish to go. It feels alive, separate from the player and is overall a unique experience.

### The Movement

Gameplay wise, this game's movement is unparalleled in terms of the feeling of reward for learning it, but feels extremely punishing to try and learn and has no training in game for most of the more complicated movement tricks. It is unbelievably lenient in what it allows for, and allows for creativity from the player to make up new ways to get around. It feels satisfying to get right and allows for more risks to be taken in game as well as alternate paths to what the game may originally seem to offer, but if gotten wrong or not known about the movement leaves the player feeling rather helpless or worse, frustrated.

It's incredibly open due to the 'active input' system it has. Very rarely is the player locked out from inputting movement commands, allowing for last second changes to a movement, or a redirection of one currently in motion. This means the system behind it has to be robust to allow for player creativity, and requires the map to be designed to encourage creativity. This is a good system, as it leaves the player fully in control.

### The Wildlife (NPCs)

The main feature of Rain World is the world you explore. The world isn't just the physical terrain in this case, but the wildlife around it. All other beings encountered, predator or prey, have their own lives and behave according to their needs. This is unlike other metroidvania style games, where the NPCs exist only to serve as 'things' they player can interact with and rarely exist to any purpose other than to create action for the player: they have no individual purpose. The NPCs in Rain World are different. Each of them has complex AI, memories, their own friends and enemies. If the player was not there, the NPCs in Rain World could still exist in a small virtual ecosystem independent of the player. As they are 'alive', they learn how the player like to move, how aggressive they are and what their favourite areas for food, and then they adapt. This helps create an environment for the player to explore beyond what games can usually offer, as the world feels more alive.

### 'Combat'

Combat in Rain World is what would usually be expected from a game of it's style. There isn't a combat system beyond picking objects up and throwing them. There is no system specifically implemented to aim, there isn't a clear health system, and the player has no permanent attack or weapon. It can feel incredibly bland, but again the active input system from the movement allows for full control of the direction of throw and for tricks such as, e.g., slide throwing to get extra damage. Each creature also has a weak point or something it fears which allows for the player to control or a situation to allow for an advantageous outcome or avoid a confrontation all together.

### User Interface

Rain world has no inventory, no energy or resource and no health bar. As a result, the UI is very sparse, and completely disabled unless in use or brought up by the player. It only tells time, karma level and the amount of food the player has. To this end, it only shows up while the player is eating, or when time is half or almost up. When paused, the menu doesn't cover up the game in an intrusive way and has 2 very clear options, nothing else. For saving, the game's unique shelter system will display your karma, how much food is left from the previous day and what progress you have on achievements. This implementation of the UI works for a simplified game such as Rain World but doesn't work for games with a more game mechanics.

| Movement            | The diverse movement system of Rain World underpins how the rest of the game is played. The implementation means there is no limit beyond what the game's physics allows for and allows for true creativity in the player's movement options. While a full active input system like the game has might be too complexed to realistically implement, something similar with broad options would create a similar feeling. |
| The 'Wildlife' NPCs | Having the NPCs learn how the player behaves and behaving entirely by their own accord creates a situation where the player's interactions feel like actual interactions, and not like a system in a game. This makes the game feel more immersive and makes each encounter unique, hence increasing replay value and allowing for difficulty to adjust itself naturally.                                                |
| User Interface      | The massively stripped down UI in Rain World contributed greatly to clarity. It removed the need for most UI elements that would usually be present in games of  its genre, and hiding the included ones when they weren't in use. It allows for focus on other aspects of the game when it matters and has an easier time looking cleaner.                                                                              |

| Combat  | This partially ties into movement, as Rain World doesn't have a defined combat system. It's hard to get to grips with and feels confusing even after several hours of play. It's extremely complicated and allows for full control as the movement does, however is too obscure and unclear for a new user. While this is the intent in Rain World, and it works beyond well in it, I do not think it's a system I want to support. |

## Hollow Knight

### Overview

Hollow Knight is one of the most highly acclaimed and best selling metroidvanias released in recent years. It sold more than 500,000 copies in its released year of 2017, doubling in the following year. Its sequel Silksong has just as large a following to the point where it is almost cult-like, despite no promised release date. It has a vast world with unique enemies and friends that inhabit each region. The combat system is diverse and adaptable: the player can make decisions on how they want to fight, or change the way they fight based off of the encounter. Nothing feels like it was forced into the game for the purpose of it being a game, as everything feels like it fits into the context of Hollow Knight's world.&#x20;

### Combat

At base level, the combat system in Hollow Knight is very simple. You can strike in 4 directions, and hitting things or being hit does damage. There are also spells: they do more damage, have range and area damage, but cost a resource to cast known as soul and are unlocked as the game progresses. The spells require you to use your nail to gain resources to cast them, and they are still useful without having to specialise for them. Despite this very simple system, the combat is diverse and leaves you with multiple options for every situation. It feels relatively balanced as any enemy you encounter at the intended time is designed to be the right type of challenging, getting more complex as you progress and get used to the game.

### Upgrades and Charms

Hollow Knight allows for full customisation in the way you do combat through its unique progression system.&#x20;

Firstly the main weapon, or 'nail'. This will most likely be used no matter what style you play. It is relatively hard to upgrade to the maximum level, and it is limited in range. You get a maximum of 3 abilities, unlocked only after tough platforming challenges at the edges of the world. As it is a weapon that costs nothing to use and is available from the beginning this is understandable for balance reasons. They simple damage upgrades require scavenging for Pale ore and collection of vast amounts of the in game currency, Geo. This means the nail should scale up to help deal with stronger enemies and never feel too strong in a new area, but are still completely optional; they are not necessary to beat a new area should the player wish to give themselves a challenge.

Secondly, the Charms. Charms in Hollow Knight are equipable tokens that give certain effects. Longer strikes, more nail damage, more soul for spells, reducing costs, increasing health, etc. Each charm has a cost associated with it, counted in notches. You start the game with a very small amount of notches, increasing as you progress allowing you to slowly customise how you play. Charms are located in hidden places, shops or as boss rewards. The effects they have an influence on how you play, and allow new ways to play. As you can have a mix, they allow for full customisation of power to the player and that player's style. As an alternative to skill points, like in Ori, they allow for changes to a playstyle depending on a situation instead of being locked into a playstyle they might decide they do not like later on.

### Soul

Hollow Knight has a resource used for both healing a spell casting collected in a few ways, called soul. It can be gathered from hitting enemies, which is the most common way of gaining soul, or from special totems which store it, going to hotsprings which have healing pools that are able to restore soul, or from a few charms. As one resource is used for both healing and spells, it requires careful use of it: does the player want to use spells to kill enemies faster and hence avoid taking damage too much, at risk of dying more easily, or leave themselves vulnerable and potentially wasting soul to gain a bit of health back. It is a good way of encouraging combat as oppose to passive play and removes the need for differing resources, decluttering the game's UI.

### Shade

When you die in a lot of games, you usually just get sent back to the previous save point, sometimes with some resource loss, but usually just progress being lost. In Hollow Knight, a part of you is left behind when you die, your 'shade'. This means you are left with a broken soul, so can collect less of it, and lose all of your money. The only way this can be retrieved is by killing your shade to return it to you. This means there is still consequence for dying, but progress loss isn't detrimental.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Combat            | The variance and complexity in combat style whilst being very basic at its core lets it be adapted to the way every player plays. The implementation is easy for any player to get to grips with and offers plenty of options for every situation, but never forcing the player into any particular option.           |
| Charms + Upgrades | The ability to switch out different parts of a character kit to change the way it is played gives full control to the player and their preferences. Furthermore, it doesn't trap the player in a certain playstyle: if they change their mind, they can.                                                              |
| Soul              | Having a resource that is gained via hitting enemies is nothing new. The idea to use it as both a defensive and offensive resource with payoffs and consequences however is a fun dynamic that, once again, lets the player take more or less risks and play how the way they want to.                                |
| Shade             | By storing part of a player's progress in a physical 'thing' the player must retrieve, there is risk to exploring recklessly but no progress is lost if care is taken to get it back. This is a good system to have as it creates consequences for the player, but also doesn't definitively create them permanently. |

### Overview

Yet another metroidvania, Ori is now a series with 2 games: Will of Wisps and the Blind Forest. They involve a large amount of platforming challenges and puzzle solving, with less a focus on combat or survival like Hollow Knight and Rain World. The world is made to feel as open as possible and movement options are near unlimited, often being blended in with the combat.&#x20;

### Combat

Combat isn't one of Ori's strong suites. It feels like the opposite of Rain World: all attacks are auto-aimed and Ori is able to tank for what seems like forever. At no point does it feel like you're in genuine danger from dying to any of the enemies which feel like they exist for the purpose of being a nuisance rather than being an actual threat. All of them can easily be avoided or killed with the basic attack. At its core, it is a very bland system for a metroidvania, however as combat isn't Ori's main focus so in this case, it isn't as big of an issue as it could be.

### Movement

#### Bash

The 'bread and butter' ability and what fixes the basic combat system for Ori. This feature single handily defines most of the game's combat and movement. The ability gives you the option to grab and hold projectiles and enemies, and use them to effectively leap frog in a direction of your choice, flinging them in the opposite direction. It turns combat into a platforming puzzle in a sense, letting you try and chain together as many enemies at once before using a large AoE attack to finish them all off, or throwing projectiles back at them. It lets the player be creative with combat and general movement, but feels very very unbalanced in the player's favour.

#### Dash

One of the most satisfying aspects of Ori's combat-platformer move set, the dash is a completely optional and overtuned ability. It allows for Ori to dash a great distance, and after upgrades do so mid-air, and to damage enemies too. It makes gaps that would require puzzles to solve easily passable, and turns makes combat further trivial. While it is a fun take on a traditional feature of the game's genre, I feel it is too strong for what it is, covering too large a distance and doing too much damage with no significant cost.

### Skill Tree

Ori gives the player experience points for completing stages and killing enemies. They allow you to level up, which gives the player no benefits apart from an upgrade point. These points are spent in the 'skill tree' to give permanent upgrades which range from bonus experience to extra jumps. They aren't something the player can take back or reset after doing, so lock the player into certain playstyles, albeit temporarily as by the end of the game you have more than enough experience to get every upgrade.&#x20;

| A Bash inspired mechanic | It's a mechanic that defines the way the player moves and fights, but is a bit too powerful. The ability to use enemies as a movement element is great for allowing player creativity, but needs to be toned down to keep a sense of challenge. |

| Skill Tree | It is too plastic - it is too. While it doesn't force the player to get any particular upgrades, it doesn't let you change your mind or change your playstyle on the fly. While it could be argued this makes in-game decisions more impactful and carry more weight, I don't think this is a good area of design to implement it. |
| Combat     | I like the implementation of combat as part of the platforming, but I feel the combat itself in isolation, without the platforming elements, isn't complicated enough for a system of its style to be included.                                                                                                                    |
| Dash       | Dashes are fun, however Ori's dash is too long ranged and has too much agency for what it is. Designing the game to be balanced around a dash like this would be difficult and limits level design.                                                                                                                                |
