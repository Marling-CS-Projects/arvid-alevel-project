# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Game Mechanics

### Smart Movement

A player will be able to move in direction, with reduced effect while moving in air. The player should be allowed to perform more complicated movements depending on if they meet certain requirements. Sliding, flipping, rolling, and wall jumps will all be a few of the features I aim to include to provide a broad range of options to the player for given situations and make the game feel smoother and more intuitive by allowing for some inventive use of included movements to get around otherwise impassable obstacles. To go with this, I plan to have variable jump height to again allow for more control, and acceleration with small delays to movement stopping at high enough momentum. I believe this will give a good feel to the movement and again expand options for the player.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
