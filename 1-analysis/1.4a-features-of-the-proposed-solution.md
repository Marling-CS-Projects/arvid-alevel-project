# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Game Mechanics

### Smart Movement

A player will be able to move in direction, with reduced effect while moving in air. The player should be allowed to perform more complicated movements depending on if they meet certain requirements. Sliding, flipping, rolling, and wall jumps will all be a few of the features I aim to include to provide a broad range of options to the player for given situations and make the game feel smoother and more intuitive by allowing for some inventive use of included movements to get around otherwise impassable obstacles. To go with this, I plan to have variable jump height to again allow for more control, and acceleration with small delays to movement stopping at high enough momentum. I believe this will give a good feel to the movement and again expand options for the player. It won't be anywhere near as beautifully crafted as Rain World's movement system, but I will aim to get a similar feel.

### NPCs

While using complicated machine learning to get the enemies to learn how the player behaves would be ideal, I think it may be too complicated for what I aim to achieve. Enemies in my game will start of simply and gradually get more challenging. Each enemy will have a unique and clear weakness and strength, and will try to learn how to best defeat the player after each encounter. They won't necessarily be smart, far from it, but will get better at aiming and predicting player movement as time goes on, and aim to do more of what the player struggles to play against. This will be annoying to make and more annoying to play. Good.

### Combat

Combat will be relatively simple: the enemies will have choreographed attacks they will use periodically, and the player will have a basic weapon they can strike with in any for 4 directions, and one ability which will use a recourse to have an added affect. I will aim to include 3 weapons: a sword, spear, and scythe. Each will have it's own unique feel, and allow for additional movements. The Spear will allow for vaulting at  the cost of reduced horizontal speed and have greater range and slower strikes than the other 2 weapons. The Scythe will allow for diagonal strikes instead of horizontal and vertical strikes like the other two weapons. It will be a more movement focused weapon by allowing the player to hook nearby enemies and use them as leverage to perform small dashes. The Sword will allow for greater acceleration and maximum speed. Overall this will allow for enough complexity for the smart enemies to make sense conceptually and variety for each player to play the way they want to.

## Limitations
