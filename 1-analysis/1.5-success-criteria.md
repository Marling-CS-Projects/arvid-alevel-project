### The 'World' (Level) and Visual Elements

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                                               | Justification                                                                                                                                        | Reference                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | The level has a range of platforming elements such as ropes, platforms, slopes.                         | This provides many ways for the player to move around the level, and hence provides variety.                                                         | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 2        | The level has 3 defined sections with unique NPCs and obstacles.                                        | Provides variety and different challenges for different areas, creating even more gameplay variety.                                                  | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 3        | The levels have an uncluttered design and clear differentiation between terrain, the player and enemies | This allows for the player to focus more easily on other gameplay elements, like combat and platforming.                                             | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 4        | The game will use different colours to differentiate between                                            | By making everything distinguishable by something as clear as different colours, the player won't have to focus on identifying hazards when playing. | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 5        | The game uses simple graphics with very stripped down UI elements, terrain, and characters.             | Reduces complexity, increases clarity, allows for better gameplay feel.                                                                              | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 6        | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                   | Clears up visual noise, and makes what the UI displays more identifiable.                                                                            | [#simplified-ui](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#simplified-ui "mention")                         |
| 7        | The UI elements won't be shown when not in use                                                          | Further reduces visual clutter, and makes it clearer when something is changing or affected and when it's not.                                       | [#simplified-ui](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#simplified-ui "mention")                         |

| 8        | Movement on the ground accelerates you as you move.                                                                                                                              | Improves the feel of the game, and potential control over speed if the player is careful.                                                                                                             | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 9        | When the player stops or moves in the opposite direction, they will continue to slide a small distance in the direction they were moving in based off of their speed.            | Once again, improves the feel of fluid movement in the game and hence how fun the game should feel when played well.                                                                                  | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 10       | Sliding on surfaces should be allowed to cover a long stretch in a short times or fit under low gaps if the player has accelerated to a high enough speed.                       | Quick optional movements are fun in gameplay and let encounters and obstacles be avoided if used well, however I don't want it being unbalanced so a condition is provided to ensure it isn't abused. | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 11       | The player will be able to swing from ropes and poles if they are at the ends of them, and have enough velocity. It will function as a higher but slower jump from these objects | More options, more fun. Won't be necessary to beat the game but will allow for more routes and depth for the player to explore and mess around with.                                                  | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 12       | When falling from a great enough height or with enough speed in a direction, the player as an option to roll to conserve some speed and keep moving.                             | More fluid movements and hence more satisfying and rewarding gameplay. More options, etc, etc.                                                                                                        | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 13       | When holding a wall, the player should be able to slide down it and perform a small jump off of it.                                                                              | Improves the feel of movement, more options, etc.                                                                                                                                                     | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 14       | The player's jump height should depend on how long they decided to hold their jump key for                                                                                       | This will let the player, once again, choose how they move and have full control over every variable.                                                                                                 | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
