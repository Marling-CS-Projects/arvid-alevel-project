| 1        | The level has a range of platforming elements such as ropes, platforms, slopes.                         | This provides many ways for the player to move around the level, and hence provides variety.                                                         | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 2        | The level has 3 defined sections with unique NPCs and obstacles.                                        | Provides variety and different challenges for different areas, creating even more gameplay variety.                                                  | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 3        | The levels have an uncluttered design and clear differentiation between terrain, the player and enemies | This allows for the player to focus more easily on other gameplay elements, like combat and platforming.                                             | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 4        | The game will use different colours to differentiate between                                            | By making everything distinguishable by something as clear as different colours, the player won't have to focus on identifying hazards when playing. | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 5        | The game uses simple graphics with very stripped down UI elements, terrain, and characters.             | Reduces complexity, increases clarity, allows for better gameplay feel.                                                                              | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 6        | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                   | Clears up visual noise, and makes what the UI displays more identifiable.                                                                            | [#simplified-ui](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#simplified-ui "mention")                         |
| 7        | The UI elements won't be shown when not in use                                                          | Further reduces visual clutter, and makes it clearer when something is changing or affected and when it's not.                                       | [#simplified-ui](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#simplified-ui "mention")                         |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
