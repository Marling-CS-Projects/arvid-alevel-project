### The 'World' (Level) and Visual Elements

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                                               | Justification                                                                                                                                        | Reference                                                                                                   |

| 1        | The level has a range of platforming elements such as ropes, platforms, slopes.                         | This provides many ways for the player to move around the level, and hence provides variety.                                                         | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 2        | The level has 3 defined sections with unique NPCs and obstacles.                                        | Provides variety and different challenges for different areas, creating even more gameplay variety.                                                  | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 3        | The levels have an uncluttered design and clear differentiation between terrain, the player and enemies | This allows for the player to focus more easily on other gameplay elements, like combat and platforming.                                             | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 4        | The game will use different colours to differentiate between                                            | By making everything distinguishable by something as clear as different colours, the player won't have to focus on identifying hazards when playing. | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 5        | The game uses simple graphics with very stripped down UI elements, terrain, and characters.             | Reduces complexity, increases clarity, allows for better gameplay feel.                                                                              | [#graphics-and-level-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-level-design "mention") |
| 6        | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                   | Clears up visual noise, and makes what the UI displays more identifiable.                                                                            | [#simplified-ui](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#simplified-ui "mention")                         |
| 7        | The UI elements won't be shown when not in use                                                          | Further reduces visual clutter, and makes it clearer when something is changing or affected and when it's not.                                       | [#simplified-ui](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#simplified-ui "mention")                         |

| 8        | Pressing the sideways arrow keys and jump key ('z' or '\\') will allow you to move left, right, and jump.                                                                        | Basic movement so the player can move, often necessary before anything more complicated is implemented.                                                                                               | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 9        | Movement on the ground accelerates you as you move.                                                                                                                              | Improves the feel of the game, and potential control over speed if the player is careful.                                                                                                             | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 10       | When the player stops or moves in the opposite direction, they will continue to slide a small distance in the direction they were moving in based off of their speed.            | Once again, improves the feel of fluid movement in the game and hence how fun the game should feel when played well.                                                                                  | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 11       | Sliding on surfaces should be allowed to cover a long stretch in a short times or fit under low gaps if the player has accelerated to a high enough speed.                       | Quick optional movements are fun in gameplay and let encounters and obstacles be avoided if used well, however I don't want it being unbalanced so a condition is provided to ensure it isn't abused. | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 12       | The player will be able to swing from ropes and poles if they are at the ends of them, and have enough velocity. It will function as a higher but slower jump from these objects | More options, more fun. Won't be necessary to beat the game but will allow for more routes and depth for the player to explore and mess around with.                                                  | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 13       | When falling from a great enough height or with enough speed in a direction, the player as an option to roll to conserve some speed and keep moving.                             | More fluid movements and hence more satisfying and rewarding gameplay. More options, etc, etc.                                                                                                        | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 14       | When holding a wall, the player should be able to slide down it and perform a small jump off of it.                                                                              | Improves the feel of movement, more options, etc.                                                                                                                                                     | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |
| 15       | The player's jump height should depend on how long they decided to hold their jump key for                                                                                       | This will let the player, once again, choose how they move and have full control over every variable.                                                                                                 | [#smart-movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement "mention") |

| 17       | Enemies will aim to strike in the direction the player is most commonly in if they miss, give lead to projectiles if the player is moving, and respawn to be better against the player's favourite weapon. | To try and get the enemies to feel more alive and threatening, they should be capable of starting to predict player movement, and 'learn' the player's favourite way to play. | [#npcs](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#npcs "mention")     |
| 18       | The player will have access to a resource that is slowly built up while fighting.                                                                                                                          | By having a resource that requires fighting, it will force the player to engage in the game's main system to have access to some of the features.                             | [#combat](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#combat "mention") |
| 19       | The player can use the resource to regenerate health after eliminating an enemy, or to use abilities and enhance certain movement.                                                                         | Discourages passive play, and hopefully encourages further engagement in the combat system.                                                                                   | [#combat](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#combat "mention") |
| 20       | The player has access to 3 different weapons to get 3 different styles of striking, and each weapon should have an affect of movement.                                                                     | Like varied movement, varied combat allows for more options for a player an increases complexity and customisation.                                                           |                                                                       |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
