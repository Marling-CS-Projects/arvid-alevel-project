# 1.4b Computational Methods

### Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Removing unneeded detail from a problem allows for the core issues to be focused and addressed properly. For my purpose, this would mean (for example) the removal of complicated graphical detail and animations, sound design and music, and some of the complicated [movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#smart-movement) and [combat](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#combat) features I proposed. If they aren't the bare minimum required for the game to be playable they can be temporarily ignored. What I would consider core features are:

* Basic health, damage and way to deal damage. More weapons, abilities and a resource bar wouldn't work without these, and aren't necessary for basic game functionality.
* Movement in both direction. Acceleration can be soon after, and sliding and dashing (or similar) can be implemented once the necessary movement is done, the latter of which require acceleration and speed measurement to be implemented in the way I want
* Jumping. Variable height would be implemented once the rest of movement is done. Flipping, rolling, and other jump-related movements require more time and would distract from the necessary elements
* A level with more than one room, and terrain to traverse that the player can move between. Climbable obstacles, and terrain dangers (spikes, acid pits) can be added when a system to build a map is constructed.
* A static camera that only changes screen when a new room is entered. This is as complicated as this will get. It's a necessity however, as the camera position will define where a room is.

### Thinking Ahead

Planning or thinking ahead, in this case, will be considering the way the game will feel to play and look like when completed, then considering the actions needed and the orders they should be taken in to achieve that result. An example of this is considering how the sliding will interact with dashes and turning. Depending on my initial implementation of this mechanic, it could prove difficult to integrate it with other mechanics. This will be something that will have to be done well, and before other mechanics to ensure it interacts with all aspects properly.

Other interaction between similar mechanics will need similar treatment, and will likely be points of difficulty throughout the whole project. To keep track of everything, clear naming and comments will be needed to make note of how they interacted last time they were tested.

### Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposing the problem, or game in this case, will require identifying sections of the game and splitting them apart into parts.&#x20;

### Thinking Logically

### Thinking Concurrently
