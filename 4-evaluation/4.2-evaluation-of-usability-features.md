# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | I could tell the player, hazards and terrain apart from each other easily | Success      |
| 2           | The in game instructions were clear and easy to follow                    | Success      |
| 3           | The controls were easy to learn and use                                   | Success      |

#### Feature 1

The game used different colours to distinguish between different aspects of the game and kept these colours consistent. I used no complexed shapes and kept the style of layouts for the screens consistent to reduce time needed to recognise new types of threat or terrain.

#### Feature 2

The instructions of the game are clearly displayed informing the player of the basics required to play the game, involving what movement is available and which keys are used for it. The instructions didn't go into too much depth to avoid creating unnecessary confusion, had contrasting text from the background and were out of the way to ensure identifying them would be easy.

#### Feature 3

The clarity of instructions didn't guarantee an experience that was easy to use for every player. I tried to consider common layouts and how the player's hands would be positioned during developement to make sure movement felt easy to control. I checked this in the usability testing to get more opinions than my own and it seems the system I implemented was mostly liked.
