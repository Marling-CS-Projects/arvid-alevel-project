# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | I could tell the player, hazards and terrain apart from each other easily | Success      |
| 2           | The in game instructions were clear and easy to use                       | Success      |
| 3           | The controls were easy to learn and use                                   | Success      |

#### Feature 1

The game used different colours to distinguish between different aspects of the game and kept these colours consistent. I used no complexed shapes and kept the style of layouts for the screens consistent to reduce time needed to recognise new types of threat or terrain.

#### Feature 2

The instructions of the game are easily accessible to the player, don't require the player to navigate s. The ease of use is a concern as the player who needs them will likely be new to the game and the&#x20;

#### Feature 3

The clarity of instructions didn't guarantee an experience that was easy to use for every player. I tried to consider common layouts and how the player's hands would be positioned during development to make sure movement felt easy to control. I checked this in the usability testing to get more opinions than my own and it seems the system I implemented was mostly liked.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                         | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | There are enough controls to feel varied, but not to the point of being overbearing (a good amount) | Success      |
| 2           | In game instructions are clear and easy to follow                                                   | Success      |

#### Feature 1

The game had enough controls to allow for extensive use of the movement system, but likely could have used a few more. Similar sentiment was reflected in usability testing, but overall there weren't so many that it impeded gameplay, but there were enough to allow for some variety and engagement from the player.

#### Feature 2

A differentiation between easy to use and easy to follow isn't necessary but can be made for the sake of it. While access to instructions is vital to assist players, they aren't much use if the player can't follow them easily. I decided to include them in a clear font on the screen but out of the way of gameplay so the player can read and play and the same time, making them easier to follow.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                                  | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | The game is decently challenging whilst remaining fun        | Success      |
| 2           | The movement system is intuitive and feels dynamic when used | Success      |

#### Feature 1

The purpose of this is to ensure the game isn't boring and feels rewarding to play and improve at, however challenge comes at the risk of being too hard, and hence being frustrating for the player and having a negative impact on enjoyment instead. I made mistakes easy to recover from and very few things posed a threat that would immediately result in a game over, but made sure that all mistakes resulting in a game over were clearly the fault of the player.

#### Feature 2

I ensured the movement was consistent in feeling for delay in inputs, if any, and that the player maintained control over most aspects of the movement. The velocity/force based system allows for creative movements by combining different sections of the system that aren't explicitly told about in the instructions. This helps the player feel engaged by providing a sense of discovery and allowing them to play with greater freedom.



## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                                                                    | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash                                                                                                                         | Success      |
| 2           | The game does not contain any bugs that negatively affect the user's experience                                                                | Success      |
| 3           | The game tolerant to strange interaction that may not have been intended and should allow them to function without crashing/causing any bugs.  | Success      |

#### Feature 1

Throughout all of my own and other's testing, there were no instances where the game stopped working, crashed, or had a significant drop in performance.

#### Feature 2

Whilst bugs were present, they were either minor issues and had little to no effect on gameplay, or ended up being implemented as features because they were enjoyable. Only one bug was encountered during testing, and was not able to be recreated later on. As this was a fringe case, the criteria of no bugs can be met due to the lack of other bugs present.

#### Feature 3

A lot of players tried using movement inputs i hadn't considered, and ended up getting interesting and enjoyable results without breaking. This means the force based system was robust enough to account for players getting creative and fulfilled a significant aim of the project.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                                                              | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The controls must be easy to use and easy to learn                                                                                       | Success      |
| 2           | The movement system must be understood, meaning the interaction between movement options can be figured out and used with relative ease. | Success      |

#### Feature 1

All players picked up the controls fairly quickly. This was further aided by the inclusion of instructions for the controls and the lack of any complicated combined inputs that may have added unnecessary complexity to the project.

#### Feature 2

Players found the expected and some unexpected movement tricks based off of the information the game provided them with. The knowledge that it was a force based system meant, for example, a greater force would maintain greater velocity while in the air than when on the ground, and the slide could only be performed on the ground. This lead to players covering great distances very quickly using a combination that was never eluded to by the game.
