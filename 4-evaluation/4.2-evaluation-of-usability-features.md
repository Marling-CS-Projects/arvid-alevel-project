## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | I could tell the player, hazards and terrain apart from each other easily | Success      |
| 2           | The in game instructions were clear and easy to use                       | Success      |
| 3           | The controls were easy to learn and use                                   | Success      |

#### Feature 1

The game used different colours to distinguish between different aspects of the game and kept these colours consistent. I used no complexed shapes and kept the style of layouts for the screens consistent to reduce time needed to recognise new types of threat or terrain.

#### Feature 2

The instructions of the game are easily accessible to the player, don't require the player to navigate s. The ease of use is a concern as the player who needs them will likely be new to the game and the&#x20;

#### Feature 3

The clarity of instructions didn't guarantee an experience that was easy to use for every player. I tried to consider common layouts and how the player's hands would be positioned during development to make sure movement felt easy to control. I checked this in the usability testing to get more opinions than my own and it seems the system I implemented was mostly liked.
