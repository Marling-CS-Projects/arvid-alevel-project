# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Level and Visual Elements

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                             | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | The level has a range of platforming elements such as walls, platforms, slopes.                         | Cycle 13             |
| 2         | The level has NPCs and/or obstacles                                                                     | Cycle 12 and 13      |
| 3         | The levels have an uncluttered design and clear differentiation between terrain, the player and hazards | Usability Testing    |
| 4         | The game will use different colours to differentiate between elements                                   | Usability Testing    |
| 5         | The game uses simple graphics with very stripped down UI elements, terrain, and characters.             | Usability Testing    |
| 6         | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                   | Usability Testing    |
| 7         | The UI elements should not be in the way of any gameplay elements.                                      | N/A                  |

#### Criterion 1

The game uses a variety of platforms at different heights and walls, all of which can be moved on normally and jumped from. I did not attempt to add slopes before usability testing and hence they were excluded from the final product.

#### Criterion 2

The game contained hazards which were a threat the player had to get around.

#### Criterion 3

The game had no significantly complexed shapes and clearly differentiated between the player, terrain and hazards, shown in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 4

This is clearly visible in given examples, and also shown in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 5

There was little to no UI, with no permanent  text there to add clutter. This can be seen in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 6

Similar to the previous, the game didn't have additional indicators outside of health and an initial prompt to use the instructions. Found in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 7

This failed because I simply forgot to add code which would hide the UI while not in use, and didn't ask any questions in usability testing to see if the UI impeded gameplay. I can infer that this criterion was passed as all questions relating to clarity received positive feedback from testers, implying the UI hasn't had significant impact on clarity.
