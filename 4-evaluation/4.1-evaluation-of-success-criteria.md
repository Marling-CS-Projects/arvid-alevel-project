# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Level and Visual Elements

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                             | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | The level has a range of platforming elements such as walls, platforms, slopes.                         | Cycle 13             |
| 2         | The level has NPCs and/or obstacles                                                                     | Cycle 12 and 13      |
| 3         | The levels have an uncluttered design and clear differentiation between terrain, the player and hazards | Usability Testing    |
| 4         | The game will use different colours to differentiate between elements                                   | Usability Testing    |
| 5         | The game uses simple graphics with very stripped down UI elements, terrain, and characters.             | Usability Testing    |
| 6         | The game will use as few UI elements as possible to reduce cluttering                                   | Usability Testing    |
| 7         | The UI elements should not be in the way of any gameplay elements.                                      | N/A                  |

#### Criterion 1

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/406aV7Rga74" %}

The game uses a variety of platforms at different heights and walls, all of which can be moved on normally and jumped from. I did not attempt to add slopes before usability testing and hence they were excluded from the final product.

#### Criterion 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game contained hazards which were a threat the player had to get around.

#### Criterion 3

The game had no significantly complexed shapes and clearly differentiated between the player, terrain and hazards, shown in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 4

This is clearly visible in given examples, and also shown in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 5

There was little to no UI, with no permanent text there to add clutter. This can be seen in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 6

Similar to the previous, the game didn't have additional indicators outside of health and an initial prompt to use the instructions. Found in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md).

#### Criterion 7

This failed because I simply forgot to add code which would hide the UI while not in use, and didn't ask any questions in usability testing to see if the UI impeded gameplay. I can infer that this criterion was passed as all questions relating to clarity received positive feedback from testers, implying the UI hasn't had significant impact on clarity.

## Movement

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                           | When was it achieved |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 8         | Pressing the sideways arrow keys and jump key ('z' or '\\') will allow you to move left, right, and jump.                                                             | Cycle 1              |
| 9         | Movement on the ground accelerates you as you move.                                                                                                                   | Cycle 1 and 2        |
| 10        | When the player stops or moves in the opposite direction, they will continue to slide a small distance in the direction they were moving in based off of their speed. | Cycle 4              |
| 11        | Sliding on surfaces should be allowed to cover a long stretch in a short times or fit under low gaps if the player has accelerated to a high enough speed.            | Cycle 8              |
| 12        | When falling from a great enough height or with enough speed in a direction, the player as an option to roll to conserve some speed and keep moving.                  | N/A                  |
| 13        | When holding a wall, the player should be able to slide down it and perform a small jump off of it.                                                                   | Cycle 11             |
| 14        | The player's jump height should depend on how long they decided to hold their jump key for                                                                            | Cycle 7              |

#### Criterion 8

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/406aV7Rga74" %}

The game used phaser to detect which keys were being pressed. These were used with a custom implementation of movement to make the player move at the end of each frame if the appropriate key was held.

#### Criterion 9

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/LPw0uoSsH0g" %}

Acceleration was done using a force based system. Force was applied and increased while the key was held, and removed when the key was removed.&#x20;

#### Criterion 10

Again, this was done using the physics based system. When the force is removed, the only force is friction from the ground so the player eventually comes to a stop. This works by applying force in the opposite direction to get a small delay to turning too.

#### Criterion 11

The slide only works when grounded and applies a sudden great force, and locking out the application of any other force. This means is works with the friction and other force-based systems to feel fluid.

#### Criterion 12

This was not implemented partially due to me forgetting to implement it, and partially because the initial attempt to faced too many issues with the force based system and the other options such as sliding and mid-air movement.

#### Criterion 13

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/406aV7Rga74" %}

The wall jump worked by providing greater resistance to vertical motion than being in open air, whilst also checking which direction the player was touching the wall in with a collider function.

#### Criterion 14

This was done by providing a constant force on the player which was removed either by force in the opposite direction or cancelled early by removing the key.

## Combat and NPC mechanics

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 15        | The player should be able to deal and take damage when hitting and being hit by enemies.                                                                                                                                                          | N/A                  |
| 16        | Enemies will aim to strike in the direction the player is most commonly in if they miss, give lead to projectiles if the player is moving, and respawn to be better against the player's favourite weapon.                                        | N/A                  |
| 17        | The player will have access to a resource that is slowly built up while fighting.                                                                                                                                                                 | N/A                  |
| 18        | The player can use the resource to regenerate health after eliminating an enemy, or to use abilities and enhance certain movement.                                                                                                                | N/A                  |
| 19        | The player has access to 3 different weapons to get 3 different styles of striking, and each weapon should have an affect of movement.                                                                                                            | N/A                  |
| 20        | One weapon should allow for vaulting, as an increased height jump, slower strikes and greater range. Another should allow for diagonal strikes instead of vertical and horizontal, and give the option to dash through enemies by grappling them. | N/A                  |
| 21        | Dying should allow enemies to learn from how you died, and improve themselves accordingly, but also not until your eyes are retrieved, which are dropped upon death.                                                                              | N/A                  |
| 22        | Attacking will by default strike in the direction you are facing, but should strike up and down when the according keys are pressed.                                                                                                              | N/A                  |

#### Criterion 15

There were no enemies in the game, so attempting to hit them doesn't achieve much.

#### Criterion 16

Once again, there are no enemies in the game so having them attack you is hard.

#### Criterion 17

There was no combat system implemented in the first place so no resource was added to be built up during combat

#### Criterion 18

While there is a health system, the lack of a resource and a combat system means the health doesn't have a way to regenerate using the proposed system, and doesn't regenerate at all due to the lack of a persistent threat, like enemies.

#### Criterion 19

As there was no combat system, there were no weapons and so weapon variety could not exist.

#### Criterion 20

Whilst a movement system exist which would support complicated movement such as vaulting, the lack of a combat system to justify weapons, and the lack of weapons as a whole, means the implementation of movement involving weapons was not possible.

#### Criterion 21

As there are no enemies, having them learn how the player died may be difficult to implement. As a result the idea of an item dropping on death was not necessary, but death as a failure state was implemented with the intention of including enemies later.

#### Criterion 22

No attacks were included because there was no combat system to utilise them. Use of weapons as a platforming tool should have been added regardless, as the use of them in this context does not require enemies to exist.

In large part, a lot of the combat and enemy based mechanics weren't included as a result of&#x20;
