# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* It currently only runs in a web browser
* It requires a keyboard to play, so no touchscreen devices can currently play it
* The gameplay is limited with one short world and no win-state
* There is currently no combat system in the game
* The graphics, while effective, aren't that visually appealing.

## Maintenance

Maintenance for this game involves various approaches, depending on if I want to increase the scope of the game, or simply refine the current iteration of the game.

### Improve

If I sought to keep the game the same, the current stage at which the code is at would not require many changes. The unnecessary complexity present in the code won't need to be worked with as much if not much has to change, so apart from fixing some current minor bugs and fine tuning some of the numerical values, the code will likely stay the same. If I wanted to release this iteration, I would also need to extend the gameplay to include a win-state - a goal for completion. Apart from that, maintenance should be relatively simple.

### Expand

Expanding the current scope would start by refining the current game with expansion in mind. This would mean addressing all the aforementioned issues and cleaning up the current code, which has a lot of unneeded complexity making improvement and expansion harder.&#x20;
